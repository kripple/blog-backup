<h2 id="monday-6-44-pm-new-beginings">Monday, 6:44 PM - New Beginings</h2>

<p>Today was spectacular for a number of reasons. Let me enumerate them for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>New people! Having new faces in the space was exciting and refreshing.</li>
<li>The material. I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised to learn that I absolutely love what we&rsquo;re working on. That being said, my brain feels as though it&rsquo;s been put through the ringer. We&rsquo;re learning A LOT of new things, all at once.</li>
<li>Our instructor is &hellip; I love our phase guide. He&rsquo;s hilarious as well as full of history trivia and life wisdom. He reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work?language=en">this guy</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>We learned a lot about networking today (the computer kind, not the chit-chat kind). Even with my fancy engineering degree, it&rsquo;s a struggle to keep up. Right now we&rsquo;re working on &lsquo;clearing away the rust&rsquo;. Today was a great day. Tomorrow will probably be a great day. Let&rsquo;s ride this wave!</p>

<p>Also, I built an anagram generator (woo!). For Phase 2, we&rsquo;re moving from algorithm-centric challenges to a more project-based curriculum. It&rsquo;s an exciting shift, if a bit intimidating.</p>

<p>Meta-learning moment of the day:</p>

<p>I had a moment today where I was completely intimidated by the task in front of me. I realized what was happening, and said it out loud a few times to different people. I.e. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really intimidated by this challenge. It doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to me right now.&rdquo; It helped to verbally acknowledge what was happening. Then I asked a coach for help with a specific question, (also telling him that I was feeling intimidated) and he ended up walking me through the problem. I still don&rsquo;t have 100% comprehension of the assignment, or even 60% comprehension, but the problem doesn&rsquo;t scare me anymore. In fact, the complexity interests me. I want to learn how all the parts and pieces fit together. I have faith in my instructors and in myself that by the time I leave here (and possibly in as soon as the next few days), I will understand. The point of this example is that it&rsquo;s flipping difficult to learn new stuff while stuck in &ldquo;omg there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m going to figure this out.&rdquo; Shifting perspective can take a lot of the pressure off.</p>

<h2 id="tuesday-10-33-pm-welcome-to-bedlam">Tuesday, 10:33 PM - Welcome to Bedlam</h2>

<p>Oh god. Day 2. This program is nuts. Completely nuts.</p>

<p>I think I learned a new thing every other minute, just about. There was very little time today I felt like I &lsquo;got it&rsquo;. They threw us into the fire, and told us to relax about it, to trust them, and I do! That&rsquo;s the crazy part. I totally trust my teachers and my guides. I&rsquo;m learning new things at a snail&rsquo;s pace, but we don&rsquo;t stop moving. It&rsquo;s crazy. I have no idea what day it is anymore, it&rsquo;s just work, work, work, work, sleep, eat, then more work. I&rsquo;m enjoying it. Never a dull moment.</p>

<p>We learned Sinatra, some more Networking, and REST. I&rsquo;m not 100% clear on what REST <em>is</em>, perhaps a naming convention? Edit: REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It&rsquo;s a philosophical concept used to describe HTTP routing. The basic idea is that you use a combination of VERB and URL, instead of the URL alone, to request webpages. This way, the same URL, when used with a different verb (such as GET, PUT, POST, DELETE), will get you to a different page. This makes for cleaner, shorter URLs, and is particularly adapted to CRUD applications, which most web apps are. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2441962/what-is-restful-routing">(JRL, stackoverflow)</a></p>

<h2 id="wednesday-3-00-pm-making-sense-yet">Wednesday, 3:00 PM - Making Sense Yet?</h2>

<p>I learned today that DBC blacklists companies that aren&rsquo;t good to our grads. It is a comfort to know that even after I graduate, these people will still have my back. I will always belong to to these people, and to this place, long after I have gone.</p>

<p>I have no idea what else happened during the day on Wednesday - I didn&rsquo;t have time to blog. I was eyeballs-deep in Sinatra and RESTful routing, late into the evening. For a while I was stuck sort of knowing that I didn&rsquo;t know what I should know. I learned last week that if I just keep my head in the problem for long enough, my brain starts to make sense of it all. At the end of the day, it was all still a jumbled mess. It started to gel on Thursday morning. Count them - three full days of not understanding what the heck is going on before the concepts started to come together for me. I have heard that DBC hires typically take far less time than traditional CS grads to come up to speed at a new job. Perhaps this is because we have learned how to learn in a pseudo-joblike environment.</p>

<p>Speaking of metalearning, when I&rsquo;m tired, learning becomes incredibly difficult. I&rsquo;m slower, and oddly prone to despair. I start comparing myself to other, less tired folks, and deciding that I&rsquo;m a worthless human being in comparison. No bueno.</p>

<h2 id="thursday-5-07-pm-it-s-making-sense">Thursday, 5:07 PM - It&rsquo;s Making Sense!!</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m exhausted, but I finally feel &lsquo;caught-up&rsquo;. We had the mother of all EE&rsquo;s yesterday. Afterwards, I dived into my work as a means of numbing my emotions and ended up working late into the evening. As to what happened in the EE &hellip; you&rsquo;ll never hear it from me. We operate on the Vegas principle - what happens in EE stays in EE. Suffice it to say that it was an emotionally taxing, uniquely rewarding, team-building / personal growth experience.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re learning how to build webapps. We&rsquo;re doing this by building webapps. Surprise!</p>

<p>Hey world, guess what, I know how to build basic webapps. Stay tuned, by the end of the week, I may even be good at it.</p>

<h2 id="friday-10-04-am-so-busy-that-it-feels-normal">Friday, 10:04 AM - So Busy That It Feels Normal</h2>

<p>I have this nagging worry/fear that I won&rsquo;t enjoy a job in tech. I&rsquo;m enjoying my experience at DBC a whole lot, but I don&rsquo;t expect that a job could possibly be as fun or engaging as this. I&rsquo;m going to quiz some of my instructiors on their webdev experiences to get some perspective.</p>

<h2 id="saturday-12-45-am-it-s-still-the-first-week-isn-t-it">Saturday, 12:45 AM - It&rsquo;s Still The First Week, Isn&rsquo;t It?</h2>

<p>(Technically Sunday). Our weekend project is nuts. It&rsquo;s not a difficult challenge, per se, but since it&rsquo;s the first time any of us have put together a website like this &hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m learning tons; that&rsquo;s all I have to say about that.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<h3 id="what-works">What works?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Trust. Trust your teachers, trust your team, trust yourself.</li>
<li>Cold brew coffee from a respectable coffee shop is so much better than Folgers coffee that the comparison itself is a tad embarassing. I&rsquo;m a bit of a neophyte when it comes to coffee, but I&rsquo;m learning.</li>
<li>Life size Jenga is exactly as fun as it sounds.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-doesn-t">What doesn&rsquo;t?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Not getting enough sleep. There&rsquo;s a line between tired and sleep-deprived, and I managed to find it this week.</li>
</ul>
